            *** THIS DIRECTORY IS FOR JEMPLATE HACKERS ONLY ***


This src directory contains various Perl and JavaScript files that get
stitched together to make the Jemplate Perl/CPAN distribution.

If you want to hack on the Jemplate parser or runtime code, you can
change the files in this directory. To build your changes into the
Jemplate distribution modules simply run:

    make

from this directory.

This directory is not included in the Jemplate CPAN distribution.
