Jemplate is Perl's Template Toolkit framework made to work for Javascript.

See 'Changes' file for recent changes.

INSTALLATION
============

Jemplate consists of both Perl and Javascript components.

For the Perl side of things you'll need Perl 5.6.1 or higher and the
latest version of the Template module (aka Template Toolkit).

Just install this like any CPAN module:

    > perl Makefile.PL
    > make
    > make test
    > make install

For the Javascript side, you need to copy `share/Jemplate.js` to your
project, and then use the `jemplate` command line tool to compile your
templates. Something like this:

    > cp ~/downloads/Jemplate-x.xx/share/Jemplate.js js/Jemplate.js
    > jemplate --compile templates/* > js/jemplates.js

Then just import those two Javascript files into your html document:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/Jemplate.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jemplates.js"></script>
