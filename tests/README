This is the JavaScript testing area for Jemplate. If you are new to
testing Jemplate, please read this.

== RUNNING THE TESTS ==

There are currently two ways to run these tests. 

1) If you have a webserver pointing at this directory you can just go to
   that URL and all the tests will run in your browser.

2) You can do the following commands:

        cd tjs
        make clean test

   The output will tell you a URL to load in your browser to run
   the tests.

== ADDING OR CHANGING TESTS ==

This directory contains a bunch of files that look like this:

    t/basic.t.html

All the tests reside in the t/ directory. They have names like:

    t/basic.t.js

Each html file runs the corresponding js test. The file index.html runs
all the tests. All of the html files are generated. To regenerate all
the files, run this command:

    make clean all

All these generated HTML files are checked into the Jemplate repository.
This is so that they will run in place on CPAN or JSAN. (Yes, you can
actually run the Jemplate tests directly from CPAN and JSAN.)

== NOTES ON TJS ==

The tjs/ directory gives you more control for running tests. You can
build/test different runtimes with commands like:

    make test
    make test-jquery
    make test-yui

All of the test files and most of the rest of the files under tjs/ are
symlinks to the canonical tests above the tjs/ directory.

Also all of the html files (and other stuff) generated by the make
commands goes under tjs/var/. These files never get checked into the
Jemplate repository.
